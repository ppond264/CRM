# Customer Segmentation
# What is Customer Segmentation?
# Tools we use
# Let's Explore!!

Let's try customer segmentation by PyCaret that we can use Spectral Clustering and KMeans Clustering

### 1. Set up
- Instrall PyCaret via [!pip install pycaret]
- Load "Supermarket Data.csv" 
- Import to Notebook

### 2. Explore Data and find new features
Let see the Supermarket Data that we have a lot of infomation about customer form the supermarket.

 
After we explore the data, we prepare customer single view by calculating some of features that we have, here are them.

- Calculated 'Total visits' 
- Calculated 'Ticket size'
- Calculated 'Total no. of SKUs'

After that we try to find new features that we think it impact to our clustering. In fact, we should research that which features really impact to the clustering.
- added 'max_date'
- added 'total_days'
- added 'recency'

Here are lasted data!

### 3. Clustering!!
now the data is ready for clustering! let's go!
#### Compare model performance
after we let the data to all of these cluster model, we have to find out that which model is highest performance
so that we find out Spectral and KMeans Clustering is good to go for it
#### Spectral Clustering 
here is the result of Spectral Clustering
#### KMeans Clustering
here is the result of KMeans Clustering

### 4. Interpret the results
Now, we have to interpret what that is mean? what is the clustering say?
for answering the questions, we have to find out propetys of any clustered data that we need to explore more!
after that, we can interpret the results fo these clustering and can name all of the clustering :D
In fact, you have to find more any research or information that can support your conclusion to make more reliable and practical.
